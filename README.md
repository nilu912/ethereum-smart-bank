# Smart Bank DApp

**Smart Bank** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity, Hardhat, and React. It enables users to perform basic banking operations like depositing, withdrawing, and transferring Ether directly within the application. The app is secured by smart contracts, which ensures transparency and eliminates intermediaries, providing users full control over their funds.

## Features

- **Deposit Ether**: Users can deposit Ether into their Smart Bank account.
- **Withdraw Ether**: Withdraw funds from the Smart Bank account to your wallet.
- **Transfer Ether**: Send Ether to another userâ€™s Smart Bank account.
- **Balance Tracking**: Keep track of your balance within the Smart Bank contract.
- **Contract Owner Access**: The contract owner can view the contract's total balance.
